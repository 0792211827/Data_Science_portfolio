# Overview
## Title: Telangana Crop Health Classification Challenge

## Overview: 
This competition focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify crop health conditions in Telangana, India. Accurate classification will help farmers and government agencies detect potential threats like pests, diseases, and environmental stresses, enabling timely interventions to improve crop yield and food security.

## Aim:
Your task is to build a predictive model that classifies crop health conditions based on various agricultural and environmental features. The target variable represents different health categories of crops.

# Importance of the Challenge
* **Improved Crop Yield:** Early detection of crop health issues enables farmers to take preventive actions, leading to better productivity.
* **Enhanced Food Security:** Accurate classification ensures efficient resource allocation to mitigate risks and stabilize food supply.
* **Sustainable Agriculture:** Data-driven decision-making promotes better farming practices and reduces losses due to unforeseen issues.
# Technologies Used
* **Python:** For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** Data visualization for insights.
* **Machine Learning Models:** Classification algorithms for predicting crop health conditions.
