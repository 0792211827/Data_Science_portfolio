# Overview

## Title:Car insurance prediction model

Overview:Welcome to the Car insurance prediction model where we will determine the probability of the car owner making a claim.The objective is to build a predictive model that determines the probability of a car owner having at least one insurance claim during a specified period.


Aim: As the Lead Data Scientist, my task is to develop and evaluate a predictive model that accurately identifies the likelihood of insurance claims, despite the inherent class imbalance in the dataset. The model should maintain high predictive accuracy across both classes, ensuring that insurers can effectively assess risk and allocate resources.

# Importance of the model
- Risk Mitigation: Accurate prediction of insurance claims assists in risk assessment and mitigation for the car Insurance Company.
- Customer Protection: Providing insights into the likelihood of claims helps in offering appropriate coverage to protect customers and their cars.
- Operational Efficiency: A robust predictive model contributes to the efficiency of insurance operations, streamlining the claims processing and management process.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Leveraging Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models.
- Machine Learning Classification Models: Exploring and implementing various classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of insurance claims.
- Data Analysis: Utilizing tools like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data manipulation and analysis.
