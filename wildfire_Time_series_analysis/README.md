# Time Series Analysis: Predicting the Burned Area of Wildfires in Zimbabwe

## Overview
Wildfires in Zimbabwe have caused significant damage, highlighting the urgent need for accurate prediction models to mitigate their effects. This project analyzes historical data on monthly burned area percentages in specific Zimbabwean regions from 2014 to 2017.

To forecast wildfire occurrences, we compared two time series models:

- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Variables)
By evaluating the performance of both models, we identified trends, seasonality, and anomalies, laying the groundwork for robust wildfire prediction and prevention strategies.

## Aim
The primary goal of this project is to:

- Develop a predictive model to forecast burned area percentages over time.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.
- Provide insights into wildfire occurrences for improved resource allocation and mitigation planning.
# Importance of the Project
- **Wildfire Mitigation:** Early detection and prediction can help minimize environmental and economic damage.
- **Policy Formation:** Insights from this project can inform policymakers on resource allocation and risk management strategies.
- **Sustainability:** Effective wildfire management contributes to the long-term sustainability of ecosystems in Zimbabwe.
## Technologies Used
The project leverages the following tools and technologies:

**Programming Language:** Python
**Libraries:**
- NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing trends and patterns in wildfire data.
- Statsmodels: For time series decomposition and modeling.
- Scikit-learn: For preprocessing and model evaluation.
