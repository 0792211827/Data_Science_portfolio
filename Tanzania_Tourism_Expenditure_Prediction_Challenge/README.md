# Tanzania Tourism Expenditure Prediction Challenge


## Overview: 
The Tanzanian tourism sector contributes 17% to the countryâ€™s GDP and 25% of all foreign exchange revenues, directly employing over 600,000 people. This hackathon aims to build a predictive model to estimate the expenditure of tourists visiting Tanzania, helping tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board offer accurate pre-visit estimates to tourists worldwide.

# Aim: 
Your task is to develop a machine learning model to predict tourist spending based on various features. The target variable is the total expenditure of a tourist during their visit.

# Importance of the Challenge
- **Economic Growth:** Supporting better financial planning and revenue optimization in the tourism sector.
- **Enhanced Visitor Experience:** Helping tourists plan their trips with accurate expenditure forecasts.
- **Business Efficiency:** Assisting stakeholders in pricing, marketing, and resource allocation.
# Technologies Used
- **Python:** For preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** Data visualization for insights.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Robust models(catboost) to predict tourist spending.
