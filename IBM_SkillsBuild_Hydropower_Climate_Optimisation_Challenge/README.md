# Hydropower Climate Optimisation Challenge

## Overview:
Welcome to the Hydropower Climate Optimisation Challenge! In the remote Kalam region of Pakistan, rural communities heavily rely on micro-hydropower plants (MHPs) for their energy needs. However, the inherent variability of water flow, coupled with unpredictable climate conditions and ongoing maintenance needs, causes significant fluctuations and potential disruptions in energy generation. This challenge focuses on building a machine learning model that accurately forecasts energy load generation (in kWh) by integrating both operational data from MHPs and relevant climatic indicators.

## Aim:
As a data scientist, your task is to develop a  model capable of predicting energy usage (kWh) with high accuracy. The model should leverage time-stamped  environmental variables such as rainfall, temperature, dew point, wind speed, and precipitation. The goal is to identify and model key relationships that drive energy production variability in off-grid, climate-sensitive contexts.

## Importance of the Challenge

- **Energy Optimization**: Accurate forecasting reduces energy waste and enables better load balancing across micro-hydropower systems.

- **Infrastructure Reliability**: By anticipating energy fluctuations, communities can prevent power outages and make more informed operational decisions.

- **Sustainable Development**: Insights from this model can support the design and management of reliable renewable energy solutions in other remote or resource-constrained areas globally.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Utilized for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development.

- **Machine Learning Regression Models**: Implementation and evaluation of algorithms such as Random Forest for continuous energy prediction.

- **Data Analysis**: Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
